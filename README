Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool" written by John Calcote and published by No
Starch Press in 2010.  The code is released under the MIT license as indicated

Implementation of the code into a Git repository in the order presented in the

Hey Andrew,

FLAIM is under the license listed here.

https://sourceforge.net/projects/flaim/?source=directory


We heard from John, the author, on the rest--he writes:

For the flaim database code I use as a sample oss project to be converted
to autotools, just use the license on the sourceforge site for flaim. MIT
is fine for everything else in the book.


Hope that puts you at ease about redistribution/modification! Cheers,
